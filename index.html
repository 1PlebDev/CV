  <h3><strong>Utility Breakdown</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>RocketDash</strong></li>
    <em>This P2E game will be based on Etherium and the races are made up of 12
      people. Players will pay a small fee to join a race and create the prize pool
      for the top 3 who place. Players of the game can level up thier rockets by
      competeing. There will also be a build function where you can combine two of your
      favorite rockets and create a new one with a chance of getting a higher rarity. </em>
  </ul>
  <ul>

    <li><strong>AstroZero</strong></li>
    <em>This NFT marketplace aims to be the goto for all artists big or small. This
      community driven project inspires to help empower and support everyone in the
      web3 space. There will be features like "Drops" that give artists the power to
      create a generative smart contract right on the marketplace as well as give
      the option to host there drop directly on the marketplace or use there own custom
      website if the choose to do so. The fee structor for the marketplace starts out
      as low as 0.25% using the native Elonone token and only mere 0.7% using Etherium!</em>

  <h3><strong>Key points I like about the project</strong></h3>
  <ul>
    <li> The project has a 100 year liquidity lock.</li>
    <li> Very active and strong <a href="https://t.me/astro_elon">community.</a></li>
    <li> The creator of Etherium Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xefafd3e43a0f5cab1dd1d454492ee8d4ea1bd053f68273d3d55f649d3005d4b4">burned</a> 40% of there supply
      which now makes it hyper-deflationary.</li>
    <li> It has also shown its strength in surviving the bear market.</li>
    <li> Active Dev from the Uk that has spoken in depth on his knowlege in voice chats.</li>
    <li> The 2% redistributions anytime the Elonone token is used whether that be
      simply from someone buying or selling on Uniswap or transactions that take place
      on the NFT marketplace or the P2E game.</li>
  </ul>
